This tutorial is a combination of a few excellent Git tutorials that I have found. You can click on the _Source_ link at the bottom of each section for more information on that topic.

To practice using Git on your own machine, try out [the official Git tutorial](http://schacon.github.com/git/gittutorial.html).

If you're unsure what Git is, [the official website](http://git-scm.com/) provides the following definition:

> Git is a __free & open source, distributed version control system__ designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.  
>   
> __Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository__ with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. __Branching and merging are fast__ and easy to do.

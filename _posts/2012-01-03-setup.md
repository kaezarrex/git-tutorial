The first thing you're going to want to do is set up your name and email address for Git to use to sign your commits.

    $ git config --global user.name "David Hazinski"
    $ git config --global user.email "david.hazinski@transloc.com"

By default that file is *~/.gitconfig* and the contents will look like this:

    [user]
            name = David Hazinski
            email = david.hazinski@transloc.com

If you want to override those values for a specific project (to use a work email address, for example), you can run the git config command without the --global option while in that project. This will add a [user] section like the one shown above to the *.git/config* file in your project's root directory.

Say you have made two branches in a repository. The first is a hotfix that will be immediately merged into master, and the second is an issue that will eventually be merged when the issue is fixed.

You can run your tests, make sure the hotfix is what you want, and merge it back into your master branch to deploy to production. You do this with the git merge command:

    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge hotfix
    Updating f42c576..3a0874c
    Fast forward
     README |    1 -
     1 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)

You'll notice the phrase "Fast forward" in that merge. Because the commit pointed to by the branch you merged in was directly upstream of the commit you're on, Git moves the pointer forward. To phrase that another way, when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit's history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together - this is called a "fast forward".

Your change is now in the snapshot of the commit pointed to by the master branch, and you can deploy your change.

After your super-important fix is deployed, you're ready to switch back to the work you were doing before you were interrupted. However, first you'll delete the hotfix branch, because you no longer need it - the master branch points at the same place. You can delete it with the -d option to git branch:

    $ git branch -d hotfix
    Deleted branch hotfix (3a0874c).

Now you can switch back to your work-in-progress branch on issue #53 and continue working on it:

    $ git checkout iss53
    Switched to branch "iss53"
    $ vim index.html
    $ git commit -a -m 'finished the new footer [issue 53]'
    [iss53]: created ad82d7a: "finished the new footer [issue 53]"
     1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

Suppose you've decided that your issue #53 work is complete and ready to be merged into your master branch. In order to do that, you'll merge in your iss53 branch, much like you merged in your hotfix branch earlier. All you have to do is check out the branch you wish to merge into and then run the git merge command:

    $ git checkout master
    $ git merge iss53
    Merge made by recursive.
     README |    1 +
     1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

This looks a bit different than the hotfix merge you did earlier. In this case, your development history has diverged from some older point. Because the commit on the branch you're on isn't a direct ancestor of the branch you're merging in, Git has to do some work. In this case, Git does a simple three-way merge, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.

Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it. This is referred to as a merge commit and is special in that it has more than one parent.

It's worth pointing out that Git determines the best common ancestor to use for its merge base; this is different than CVS or Subversion (before version 1.5), where the developer doing the merge has to figure out the best merge base for themselves. This makes merging a heck of a lot easier in Git than in these other systems.

Now that your work is merged in, you have no further need for the iss53 branch. You can delete it and then manually close the ticket in your ticket-tracking system:

    $ git branch -d iss53
